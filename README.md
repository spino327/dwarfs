dwarfs
======

Parallel dwarfs implementations. This repository is a collection of the parallel dwarfs, implemented either by me (spino327) or collected from other developers. If the code is from another developer, the licensing of each dwarfs is kept as the original author released it. If there are modifications introduced those are going to be stated in the README file.
